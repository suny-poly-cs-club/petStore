This challenge will invlove using object oriented concepts.

First create a customer class. They'll have the private data memebers: Name, age, favAnimal, favColor, favGender

Create associated accessors and mutators.

Next we will make a animal class. This will have priavte memebers of animalName, age, color, gender.

Create associated accessors and mutators.

Next we will make a petStore Class. This will consist of a 2D array of pets all of which have random things for each field.

create an array of customer that each have random things for each field.

Create a method that takes in a customer. This method will traverse the 2D array of pets. If the pet's animalName, and color, and gender are equal to
the customer's favAnimal, favColor, and favGender. Set the spot in the 2D array equal to null and exit the loop. Then print out "Name bought a gender color animal"

If the customer doesn't see an animal whose animalName, color, and gender are equal to their favAnimal, favColor, and favGender. Create another loop that 
traverses the 2D array and check if the color and animalName equal the customer's favAnimal and favColor. If found, set the index in
the 2D array to null, exit the loop and print "Name bought a gender color animal"

If the customer doesn't see an animal whose animalName and color aren't equal to the customer's favAnimal and favColor. Create a loop that traverses the
2D array and checks to see if animalName equals favAnimal. If so. Set that index in the 2D array to null, exit the loop and print
"Name bought a gender color animal"

If none of the other loops find an animal that the customer could want print out "Name didn't buy any pets"
